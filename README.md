This project was produced for the purpose of designing the robot vision system and vision system at Hanyang University ERICA. The robot vision system is a machine vision system using a robot and is a high-speed/fixed-precision, real-time visual sensor system that performs various robot tasks. Using Xytron's Xycar-X model, we learn the robot vision system for autonomous vehicles.
